The Cyber Security Assessment App is a web application based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase designed for Employees. It features 20 scenario-based cybersecurity questions, each worth one mark. Employees can review their answers immediately after saving them. Upon completing the quiz, users can view their results, including their score and percentage. The employee ID, score, score percentage, remark and timestamp are stored in the Firebase database, which can be accessed by the admin.
